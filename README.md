# TextToSteamEmote
Copy and Paste your text and translate it into steam emojis

YOU ALSO NEED JAVA FOR IT TO WORK

Look at the LetterToEmote.txt file

You'll notice that the file looks something like this:

a a

b b

c c

And so on.

All you have to do is replace the second occurance of the letter with your emoji of choice

Example:

a :csgoa:

Once done double click the .bat file (just runs the code for you). A terminal should appear. All you have to do type out your message and press enter. A emoji form of your message should appear. just copy it and past it into steam.
